We just uploaded our newest preprint! Find the paper *[A convergent adaptive finite element stochastic Galerkin method based on multilevel expansions of random fields]((https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13770))* on *[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13770)*. If you want to recreate our numerical experiments, you can find our julia code in *[this repository](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/bachmayr/asgfemmlrrc)*.
